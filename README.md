This code has not been updated since the migration of the Python code to
JavaScript. So, the code has not been updated for a really long time,
but I still put it here for a kind of archive.

This code is quite messy since it was my first time coding with Python, but indeed I have
known more about programming by the experience with it. It was the time there is no official
type-specifying support, which caused me eventually moving to using TypeScript at the end.
Though also, the limitations in JavaScript are indeed more relieved compared with Python
in my opinions. That said, coding in JavaScript can be more clear of what is being what,
but less often in Python.
